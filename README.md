Alarm Oracle is a semi-supervised, Hawkes-process graph neural network used to conduct root cause analysis on alarm cascades.  It works iteratively by finding root causes with high confidence, adding them to the list of known root causes and beginning again. It has been specifically tailored to maintain high-precision at the expense of precision.  That is, it frequently does not identify all causasl correlations; however, the correlations it finds are incredibly likely to be true and accurate.  In practice, this is a tool that is used by domain experts to diagnose and analyze network alarm data.  Alarm Oracle works with the network administrator to identify the structures underlying alarm cascades.  The administrator then either fixes the cause of the cascade, or adds it to known root causes for future analysis.

## Problem
## Real examples of disasters caused by alarm floods and cascades.
###vThree Mile Island Nuclear Accident (1979)
The Three Mile Island incident is perhaps one of the most cited cases when discussing the dangers of alarm floods. A reactor at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, suffered a partial meltdown on March 28, 1979. After a series of mechanical failures, including a stuck valve and cooling malfunctions, operators were bombarded with over 100 alarms in a short period. These alarms came in the form of lights, sounds, and gauges showing abnormal conditions.

The inundation of alarms overwhelmed the operators and severely hampered their ability to diagnose the situation accurately. The cacophony of alarms led to sensory overload, making it difficult to prioritize responses or even understand what was going wrong. While other human and mechanical factors also contributed, the alarm cascade effectively delayed quick and precise intervention, leading to the release of a small amount of radioactive gases.

### Piper Alpha Oil Platform Disaster (1988)
Another case where alarm cascades played a role was the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea. On July 6, 1988, a series of explosions and fires destroyed the Piper Alpha oil platform, resulting in 167 deaths. A gas leak initiated a fire, which then triggered a series of additional events and alarms. The alarm systems were not designed to handle such a high level of complexity and interdependence between various systems.

Operators were inundated with alarms but had no effective way to prioritize them. The situation was made worse by the absence of an automatic shutdown system for certain parts of the platform. The crew was overwhelmed, and emergency procedures proved to be woefully inadequate, partly because of the confusion caused by the numerous alarms.

### Texas City Refinery Explosion (2005)
In this case, a BP oil refinery in Texas City exploded, killing 15 workers and injuring over 180 others. While human errors and neglect of safety procedures were the primary causes, the control room was subjected to multiple alarms without clear prioritization. Operators failed to notice key indicators of an impending disaster, partially due to the high number of alarms that they had become conditioned to ignore. This phenomenon, often called "alarm fatigue," led to delays in taking preventive action.

### Healthcare and Alarm Fatigue
In modern healthcare settings, especially intensive care units, alarm fatigue has become a significant problem. Medical staff are exposed to a plethora of alarms from various equipment like heart rate monitors, ventilators, and infusion pumps. The frequent alarms desensitize the healthcare workers, making it more likely for them to miss or delay responses to critical alarms. This has led to preventable adverse events, although these are typically not as dramatic as large-scale industrial accidents.

### Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
In the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), alarm cascades could potentially become a significant issue. As industrial settings become more interconnected, the risk of an alarm flood that could overwhelm operators grows. While not a specific incident, it's an area of concern that is gaining attention.

### Cybersecurity Incidents
In cybersecurity, false alarms or too many simultaneous alarms can also be an issue, potentially causing operators to miss critical intrusion detection warnings. However, these are generally not discussed in the same context as physical safety incidents like those at Three Mile Island or Piper Alpha.

These incidents highlight the need for smarter, more adaptive alarm management systems. Modern approaches often involve using AI and machine learning to predict and prioritize alarms, thereby aiding human operators in making more informed decisions under pressure.

Talk about the network causal alarm problem

First of all, the number of alarms occurring in a power system simultaneously when
a fault occurs is a crucial issue to concern. Once the Hydro-Qu√©bec Regional Control
Center reported the maximum number of alarms which could be triggered by several
types of events as follows (Durocher, 1990):
z up to 150 alarms in 2 seconds for a transformer fault;
z up to 2000 alarms for a generation substation fault, the first 300 alarms being
generated during the first 5 seconds;
z up to 20 alarms per seconds during a thunderstorm;
z up to 15000 alarms for each regional center during the first 5 seconds of a complete system collapse

Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, vol 97. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21697-8_22



In modern control rooms, there is a constant risk of
information overload. In particular, as soon as there is a
larger disturbance, the alarm system tends to overflow
with alarms. This, in turn, makes the alarm list and the
alarm system less useful, especially in situations where it
would be most beneficial. In fact, when an incident starts,
operators tend to disregard the alarm list, and only when
the incident has been taken care of, they return to the list,
remove all waiting alarms, and then start using it for
monitoring. This effect seems to be more common the
better equipped the systems is with alarms, and is well
known in nuclear control rooms.

Every day, tens of thousands of faults are triggered across heterogeneous and interconnected devices in a telecom network. These faults are expressed by the network devices in the form of alarms, which are transmitted to the Network Operation Centre (NOC) for further processing by network operators. Additionally, there are thousands of types of alarms. If the network operators handle all alarms sequentially, they will be overloaded and unable to concentrate on finding the underlying reasons for the faults. Generally, approximately 1 million alarms are reported to the NOC every day. If there are five network operators working 8 h per day, each operator must process 20 alarms every minute throughout the day, which is an impossible workload. Therefore, it is necessary to select the important alarms that are useful for identifying network problems.

## Data
Talk about modeling the procedural data generation after real world networks.

## Model
TemporalProcessMiner - A Hybrid Approach to Temporal Causal Discovery
Introduction (Revised):
TemporalProcessMiner aims to discover causal relationships in event-based temporal networks using a hybrid approach that combines graph theory, statistical learning, and optimization techniques. This enriched framework encapsulates NetworkX graphs, pandas DataFrames, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Hawkes processes, Poisson processes, and optimization methods.

Key Structures (Revised):
Poisson Processes: These are employed for the basic modeling of random events in the network when no historical events are considered.
Hawkes Processes: Extends Poisson processes by including the memory of past events to predict the conditional intensity of future events.
Modalities (Revised):
Stochastic Processes: The algorithm integrates Hawkes and Poisson processes for a nuanced understanding of temporal event dynamics.
Optimization Techniques: Employs gradient descent and hill climbing to optimize hyperparameters and causal weights.
Algorithmic Steps (Augmented):
Initialization (Revised):

Utilizes Poisson processes to provide initial estimates for events that do not have prior occurrences.
Hop-Analysis (Augmented):

Applies Dijkstra's algorithm to map the shortest paths between nodes, and to determine k-hop neighbors.
Hawkes Process Modeling:

Utilizes the memory function to model the intensity of events as influenced by previous events.
Expectation-Maximization (EM) (Augmented):

Employs Hawkes processes within the EM algorithm to better fit the event data and update causal matrices.
Gradient Descent & Hill Climbing:

Gradient descent is used for continuous optimization of causal impact weights.
Hill climbing is used for discrete optimization problems, such as choosing the optimal number of 'k-hops'.
Stopping Criteria (Augmented):

Uses Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) along with the performance of gradient descent and hill climbing to decide when to stop iterations.
Complexity (Revised):
The addition of Hawkes processes and optimization techniques slightly increases the computational complexity but enhances the algorithm's predictive performance.
Conclusion (Revised):
TemporalProcessMiner is a sophisticated and versatile algorithm that efficiently integrates multiple computational and statistical techniques. With its hybrid approach of using graph-theoretical, statistical, and optimization methods, it provides a powerful tool for complex temporal causal discovery in various applications
## Results
Some additional points.  Alarms and any alrams they trigger are probabilistic.  The chcance of an alarm occuring in any second on any device is 1e-8.  Additionally, an alarm cannot reach across the network if the subsequent alarm that can be triggered is not on the same device or a neighboring device.  Thus, while there exists causal relationships in the alarm matrix, it is possible for such an alarm to not be in the data.  This could be either because the time window didn't capture sufficient evidence of the event, or the topology precludes it.

## Real world Application

## Future work
This section needs heavilty stresseed that this is preliminary work.  In fact, we need to express this throughout the slideshow and readme.  Future work could include comparing device topologies with alarm data and information to eliminate possibilities prior to analysis.  Another method would be to have multiple windows of time from the same topology.  An analysis is ran, and some high confidence causalities are added to bolster the prior information given to the model.
