Alarm Oracle is a semi-supervised, Hawkes-process graph neural network used to conduct root cause analysis on alarm cascades.  It works iteratively by finding root causes with high confidence, adding them to the list of known root causes and beginning again. It has been specifically tailored to maintain high-precision at the expense of precision.  That is, it frequently does not identify all causasl correlations; however, the correlations it finds are incredibly likely to be true and accurate.  In practice, this is a tool that is used by domain experts to diagnose and analyze network alarm data.  Alarm Oracle works with the network administrator to identify the structures underlying alarm cascades.  The administrator then either fixes the cause of the cascade, or adds it to known root causes for future analysis.

## Problem
Talk about the network causal alarm problem

First of all, the number of alarms occurring in a power system simultaneously when
a fault occurs is a crucial issue to concern. Once the Hydro-Qu√©bec Regional Control
Center reported the maximum number of alarms which could be triggered by several
types of events as follows (Durocher, 1990):
z up to 150 alarms in 2 seconds for a transformer fault;
z up to 2000 alarms for a generation substation fault, the first 300 alarms being
generated during the first 5 seconds;
z up to 20 alarms per seconds during a thunderstorm;
z up to 15000 alarms for each regional center during the first 5 seconds of a complete system collapse

In modern control rooms, there is a constant risk of
information overload. In particular, as soon as there is a
larger disturbance, the alarm system tends to overflow
with alarms. This, in turn, makes the alarm list and the
alarm system less useful, especially in situations where it
would be most beneficial. In fact, when an incident starts,
operators tend to disregard the alarm list, and only when
the incident has been taken care of, they return to the list,
remove all waiting alarms, and then start using it for
monitoring. This effect seems to be more common the
better equipped the systems is with alarms, and is well
known in nuclear control rooms.

Every day, tens of thousands of faults are triggered across heterogeneous and interconnected devices in a telecom network. These faults are expressed by the network devices in the form of alarms, which are transmitted to the Network Operation Centre (NOC) for further processing by network operators. Additionally, there are thousands of types of alarms. If the network operators handle all alarms sequentially, they will be overloaded and unable to concentrate on finding the underlying reasons for the faults. Generally, approximately 1 million alarms are reported to the NOC every day. If there are five network operators working 8 h per day, each operator must process 20 alarms every minute throughout the day, which is an impossible workload. Therefore, it is necessary to select the important alarms that are useful for identifying network problems.

## Data
Talk about modeling the procedural data generation after real world networks.

## Model
TemporalProcessMiner - A Hybrid Approach to Temporal Causal Discovery
Introduction (Revised):
TemporalProcessMiner aims to discover causal relationships in event-based temporal networks using a hybrid approach that combines graph theory, statistical learning, and optimization techniques. This enriched framework encapsulates NetworkX graphs, pandas DataFrames, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Hawkes processes, Poisson processes, and optimization methods.

Key Structures (Revised):
Poisson Processes: These are employed for the basic modeling of random events in the network when no historical events are considered.
Hawkes Processes: Extends Poisson processes by including the memory of past events to predict the conditional intensity of future events.
Modalities (Revised):
Stochastic Processes: The algorithm integrates Hawkes and Poisson processes for a nuanced understanding of temporal event dynamics.
Optimization Techniques: Employs gradient descent and hill climbing to optimize hyperparameters and causal weights.
Algorithmic Steps (Augmented):
Initialization (Revised):

Utilizes Poisson processes to provide initial estimates for events that do not have prior occurrences.
Hop-Analysis (Augmented):

Applies Dijkstra's algorithm to map the shortest paths between nodes, and to determine k-hop neighbors.
Hawkes Process Modeling:

Utilizes the memory function to model the intensity of events as influenced by previous events.
Expectation-Maximization (EM) (Augmented):

Employs Hawkes processes within the EM algorithm to better fit the event data and update causal matrices.
Gradient Descent & Hill Climbing:

Gradient descent is used for continuous optimization of causal impact weights.
Hill climbing is used for discrete optimization problems, such as choosing the optimal number of 'k-hops'.
Stopping Criteria (Augmented):

Uses Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) along with the performance of gradient descent and hill climbing to decide when to stop iterations.
Complexity (Revised):
The addition of Hawkes processes and optimization techniques slightly increases the computational complexity but enhances the algorithm's predictive performance.
Conclusion (Revised):
TemporalProcessMiner is a sophisticated and versatile algorithm that efficiently integrates multiple computational and statistical techniques. With its hybrid approach of using graph-theoretical, statistical, and optimization methods, it provides a powerful tool for complex temporal causal discovery in various applications
## Results
Some additional points.  Alarms and any alrams they trigger are probabilistic.  The chcance of an alarm occuring in any second on any device is 1e-8.  Additionally, an alarm cannot reach across the network if the subsequent alarm that can be triggered is not on the same device or a neighboring device.  Thus, while there exists causal relationships in the alarm matrix, it is possible for such an alarm to not be in the data.  This could be either because the time window didn't capture sufficient evidence of the event, or the topology precludes it.

## Real world Application

## Future work
This section needs heavilty stresseed that this is preliminary work.  In fact, we need to express this throughout the slideshow and readme.  Future work could include comparing device topologies with alarm data and information to eliminate possibilities prior to analysis.  Another method would be to have multiple windows of time from the same topology.  An analysis is ran, and some high confidence causalities are added to bolster the prior information given to the model.
